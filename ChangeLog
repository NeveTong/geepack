	* Søren Højsgaard joined the development with geeglm, which 
	"works like" glm and returns an object which is similar to 
	a glm object. Residuals and predicted values can be extracted
	using the generic functions as with a glm object. 

	* An important feature of geeglm, is that an anova method 
	exists for these models.
